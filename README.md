# Building an NFT contract
This repository is part of my studies about web3 and blockchain development

## What was developed
In this simple project, it was developed a smart contract in solidity to create a NFT.

It was based on ERC721 Token ("https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol")
